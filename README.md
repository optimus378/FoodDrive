# FoodDrive

This is a little web app for a Food Drive. The food drive is a door to door one. Real Estate Agents select a few streets in the area
to door knock and ask for dry food donations to be placed in a bag by their door step. They would knock the door, deliver the bag, and come 
the next week to pick up the food. 

This app was created so that agents could go to a centralized locaton, enter their Name and email, resever the streets they wanted 
using Google Maps API, and the number of Food Drive Bags they would need. 

If the street was already selected, it would let them know. 

Previous years was an administrative nightmare as it was uncentralized and done via email and a shared google sheet across multiple Market Centers.
